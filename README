DOOM-FIRE-DOS
-------------

This algorithm was originally made by @filipedeschamps, I just implemented it in C for the x86 DOS System.

I also created a minimal graphics library using the 13h VGA mode (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h). You can edit it and use in your program if you want. 

It is recommended to use 60.000 cycles or more in DosBox to have a good result. It is equivalent to a 60 MHz 486 processor.

If you don't want to download DosBox, you can check out the demo in /demo.gif.

You can download the binary file 'MAIN.EXE' in the '/BIN' directory or compile it with the Borland C++ compiler for DOS with:
`%BORLAND_CPP_PATH%/BIN/TCC MAIN.C`
